Today, I began exploring the Queue data structure — an essential linear data structure following the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, widely used in scheduling, resource management, and real-time data handling.

📌 Topics Covered:
1️⃣ Introduction to Queues – Understanding the concept, operations, and use cases.
2️⃣ Implementation of Queues using Arrays.
3️⃣ Circular Queues using Arrays – Optimizing space and overcoming array limitations.
4️⃣ Queue Implementation using Linked List – Dynamic memory allocation for efficient storage.
